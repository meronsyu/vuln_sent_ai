In recent years, it has become common to create programs using generative AI, but it has been pointed out that AI-generated programs have vulnerabilities. However, AI-generated programs have been found to be vulnerable, according to a study by The FormAI Dataset: Generative AI in Software Security through the Lens of Formal Verification (2023). found vulnerabilities in 51.24% of programs created using ChatGPT Turbo 3-5. Services using programs containing vulnerabilities have a higher risk of security problems. Therefore, it is important to reduce vulnerabilities when creating programs using AI. In this repository, we will verify whether AI-generated programs can be made less vulnerable by modifying the prompts. Specifically, we will clarify how expressions such as emotion, which seemingly have no direct relation to improving program accuracy, affect the vulnerability of the generated programs. A possible conclusion of this repository is that the use of prompts that include respect and positive emotions can reduce the vulnerability of AI-generated programs. This will reduce security risks in AI-based software development.
